# Contributing to aivyx-yubi

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Before you open a PR

- For anything beyond a small fix, please open an issue first to describe
  the shape of the change so we can agree on the approach.
- Keep changes focused — a PR should do one thing.

## Building & testing

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

Note: real hardware tests require `pcscd` running to talk to a physical
card — see the README for setup. Most of the test suite runs against a
fake `CardBackend` and needs no hardware.
